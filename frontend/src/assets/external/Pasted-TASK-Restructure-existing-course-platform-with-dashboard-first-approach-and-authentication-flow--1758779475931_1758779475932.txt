TASK: Restructure existing course platform with dashboard-first approach and authentication flow

CURRENT WEBSITE STRUCTURE:
- Landing page with course assessment
- Assessment questions (3 React questions)
- Assessment results page
- Login/Signup pages
- Course content page with video/text toggle
- Dark theme throughout

REQUIRED CHANGES:

1. RESTRUCTURE ROUTING FLOW:
   OLD FLOW: Landing → Assessment → Results → Login/Signup → Course
   NEW FLOW: Dashboard (Landing) → Login/Signup Modal → Dashboard → Course

2. CONVERT DASHBOARD TO MAIN LANDING PAGE:
   - Make dashboard the default route ("/")
   - Remove the old landing page assessment flow
   - Dashboard shows all available courses without requiring login
   - Users can browse freely, see course details, but cannot enroll without auth

3. DASHBOARD CONTENT (using existing dark theme):
   - Header: Platform logo, search bar, cart icon (0), login/signup buttons
   - Hero section: "Welcome to Your Learning Journey" with call-to-action
   - Course grid showing 5 static courses:
     * AI in Web Development (8hrs, $49, Beginner, 2847 students)
     * Full Stack React Mastery (12hrs, $79, Intermediate, 1523 students)  
     * Python for Automation (6hrs, $39, Beginner, 3241 students)
     * Advanced JavaScript (10hrs, $69, Advanced, 987 students)
     * DevOps for Developers (15hrs, $99, Intermediate, 756 students)

4. AUTHENTICATION TRIGGER SYSTEM:
   - When user clicks "Enroll Now" or "Add to Cart" on any course
   - Show login/signup modal overlay (not new page)
   - Store user's intended action (courseId, action type) in sessionStorage
   - After successful login/signup, execute the stored intent:
     * If "Enroll Now" → redirect to that specific course
     * If "Add to Cart" → add item to cart and show success message

5. UPDATE LOGIN/SIGNUP MODAL:
   - Convert existing login/signup pages to modal components
   - Add phone number field to signup form
   - Keep existing styling and dark theme
   - Add close button (X) to return to dashboard
   - Success message after auth: "Welcome! Redirecting to [Course Name]..."

6. COURSE POPUP ENHANCEMENT:
   - Add "Quick View" button to each course card
   - Show course popup with:
     * Course name, description, curriculum preview
     * Duration, price, difficulty, student count
     * Two buttons: "Enroll Now" and "Add to Cart"
   - If not logged in,
